        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (19 ounce) can Southern-style flaky refrigerated biscuits (such as Pillsbury Grands)</li>
        <li>32 slices pepperoni</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line air fryer basket with parchment paper. Spray parchment paper with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Separate biscuits into 8 pieces and flatten each into 6 inch large discs. Top each disc with 1 tablespoon spaghetti sauce and spread out within 1/4 inch of the edge. Top with 2 tablespoons cheese and 4 slices pepperoni, overlapping. Pull sides of biscuits up and pinch together to seal. Place biscuits in the air fryer basket, sealed side down. Brush with butter.</li>
        <li>Cook in the air fryer until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
